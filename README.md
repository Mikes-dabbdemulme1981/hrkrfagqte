Okay, so just walked out of Demon City — my god what was that? The theater was so noisy, I swear the lady next to me was crunching popcorn like she was auditioning for a concrete crusher gig. Back is achey, you know, those seats!! Like tortured marshmallows, they mold you into weird angles. Anyway, the movie.

Demons, but not your typical ones, more like if thunderstorms had feelings? Yes, they crackled all over the place, bits of dark clouds swirling. Ugh, my jacket still smells like stale butter — someone spilled popcorn all over. There was that one scene where the main character (who looks a bit like my uncle Jerry, honestly) is running through a storm of glass shards, oh wait no, it was frozen tears — yeah, that's it. The special effects were like, um, a meteorological disaster but make it art.

> There was this alley fight scene riiight before I remembered, oh, Sam wanted me to download the movie for his road trip. But honestly, live through the storm first, watch the movie with an escape plan. Odd how my brain jumped between the sound design (like ten squirrels on caffeine) and thinking if I forgot to lock the car. You know, multi-tasking disasters.

And the villain, what was his deal? Like a weather forecast gone wrong. Halfway through, boom, there, he’s summoning mini tornadoes but then decides fruit off the cart is a better projectile weapon? A cohesive mess, if that makes any sense. Demons and daily chaos, barely making sense like my uncle's stories at family dinners, strands of dialogue getting lost under mountains of special effects. The noise oh my god.

Sudden thought mid-movie, someone's apple rolled down the aisle, like, we need edible fables not forgotten fruit! Or maybe that's profound? No, that’s probably just dumb. But you don't see apples in demon movies much, not since Snow White’s heyday.

Catch a good angle of that fiery phoenix by sneezing just right or blink and miss it. What is this, a quirky 90's sitcom flashback? I'm craving nachos now — odd cue, probably psychological warfare from the snack counter. Don’t ask how it connects.
